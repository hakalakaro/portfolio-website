# Portfolio-website
A portfolio website I created using an online tutorial. 

The site consist of home, about, services, portfolio and contact sections. 
User can change the theme colors and activate day or night mode to toggle light or dark layout. 

The site has been created using HTML, Javascript and CSS.
